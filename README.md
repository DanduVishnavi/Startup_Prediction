# 🚀 AI Startup Success Predictor

An AI-powered web application that predicts whether a startup will:

- ✅ Operate Successfully  
- ❌ Fail / Close  
- 💼 Get Acquired  

The system uses Machine Learning to analyze financial and business indicators and provides a confidence score along with risk level.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project integrates a trained Machine Learning model with a Flask-based web application.  
Users can input startup-related parameters, and the system predicts the likely outcome.

The model evaluates:

- Financial strength
- Investor confidence
- Business growth indicators
- Market recognition
- Venture capital involvement

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model was trained using historical startup data.

### 🎯 Target Classes:
- `Operating` – Successful startup
- `Closed` – Failed startup
- `Acquired` – Highly successful startup

### 📊 Input Features:

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Total Funding | Total capital raised |
| Funding Rounds | Number of investment rounds |
| Business Relationships | Partnerships and connections |
| Milestones | Achievements and growth stages |
| Average Investors | Average investor participation |
| Top 500 Status | Whether startup is recognized |
| Venture Capital | VC funding availability |
| Age at First Funding | Startup maturity at first funding |
